[Word Analytics](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/1e97ob/051313_challenge_125_easy_word_analytics/)

Description:
===========
You're a newly hired engineer for a brand-new company that's building a "killer Word-like application". You've been specifically assigned to implement a tool that gives the user some details on common word usage, letter usage, and some other analytics for a given document! More specifically, you must read a given text file (no special formatting, just a plain ASCII text file) and print off the following details:

1. Number of words
2. Number of letters
3. Number of symbols (any non-letter and non-digit character, excluding white spaces)
4. Top three most common words (you may count "small words", such as "it" or "the")
5. Top three most common letters
6. Most common first word of a paragraph (paragraph being defined as a block of text with an empty line above it) (Optional bonus)
7. Number of words only used once (Optional bonus)
8. All letters not used in the document (Optional bonus)

Note that your tool does not have to be case sensitive, meaning the word "Hello" is the same as "hello" and "HELLO".
